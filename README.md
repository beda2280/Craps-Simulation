# Craps-Simulation 

Kedir Bedaso,

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Software Engineering, while working professionally as a web and window-based Applications Development Engineer. C#, VB.net, .NET, Java, jQuery, Visual Studio, and Eclipse are currently my main languages/environments used professionally. I am focused on growing my experience and skills in full stack development and I am comfortable working on both the back and front end of applications. In the future, I would like to explore IoT, mobile application development.

Academically, I have studied development topics including intermediate software development, abstract data structures, object creation and usage, application performance, agile/scrum framework and waterfall development process, application testing, use case analysis, specification and instruction documentation, team and project communication, database design, development, SQL language usage and optimization
